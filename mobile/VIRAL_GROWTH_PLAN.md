# INVTL Viral Growth Strategy

## The Problem
You have a great app, but users need **reasons to share** and **ways to invite friends**.

```
User Runs → Captures Zone → Wants to Brag → Shares → Friend Sees → Downloads → User Gets Reward

## My Recommendation: Build These 3 Features NOW

**Why:** Immediate viral potential
**What:** Instagram-worthy shareable image

```
[Share Card Design]
┌─────────────────────┐
│  [Route Map]        │
│                     │
│  5.2 km    32 min   │
│                     │
│  👑 3 Zones Captured│
│                     │
│  #INVTL #RunCapture │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### 2. "Your Zone Was Stolen!" (1 day)
**Why:** Creates urgency to open app
**What:** Push notification when someone takes your zone

### 3. Squad System (3 days)
**Why:** Groups bring groups
**What:** Create/join squads, compete together

---

## Marketing Tactics (While I Build)

### What You Should Do:
1. **Create Instagram account** - Post daily route art
2. **Find 10 running groups** in Bangalore - Offer free premium
3. **Partner with local gyms** - Put up posters
4. **Host Saturday morning runs** - Free + capture zones together
5. **TikTok/Reels content** - "I ran 5km to capture this zone"

1. Immediate viral loop
